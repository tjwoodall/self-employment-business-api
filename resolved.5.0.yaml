      summary: Create a Self-Employment Period Summary
      description: |
        This endpoint enables you to create a self-employment period summary for submission of periodic data.
        Submissions must include values for incomes, expenses and deductions, even if the values are zero.
        For example, if there is no income for the period, submit a periodIncome object with 'turnover' and 'other' values of zero.
        A National Insurance number and business ID must be provided.

        <strong>Note: This endpoint can only be used for submissions for tax year 2024-25 or earlier.
        New endpoints which support cumulative submission will be provided for tax year 2025-26 onwards</strong>.
